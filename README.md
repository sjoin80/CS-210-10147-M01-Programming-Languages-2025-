üìå Portfolio Reflection: Corner Grocer Item Tracker (C++)
Name: Shelby Joiner
Course: CS210
Project: Corner Grocer Item Tracker
Language Used: C++

üß† Project Overview
This project involved designing a C++ program called the Corner Grocer Item Tracker, which reads grocery item data from a file and provides a user-friendly menu to interact with the data. The program allows users to:

Look up the frequency of a specific item (case-insensitive)

Display all item frequencies

Show a histogram of item purchases

Save item data to a file

I used file handling, maps for frequency tracking, string manipulation, and object-oriented programming principles. Clear and detailed comments are included throughout the code to explain the functionality and decision-making behind each component.

üîç What I Learned
Data Structures: I gained practical experience using std::map to store and retrieve item frequencies efficiently.

Input Handling: I learned to clean and validate user inputs and file data using string trimming, case conversion, and alphabetic checks.

File I/O: I improved my understanding of reading from and writing to external files using ifstream and ofstream.

Object-Oriented Design: I encapsulated program logic into a class (GroceryTracker) which makes the code modular, organized, and easy to maintain.

Case Insensitivity Handling: I created a dual-map structure to maintain original item names while allowing case-insensitive searches ‚Äî a real-world UX consideration.

üß∞ Skills Demonstrated
Writing clean, maintainable C++ code

Designing a class-based program

Implementing validation and error-handling

Using file streams and STL containers

Applying thoughtful commenting and documentation practices

‚ú® Why I Chose This Project
I selected this project for my portfolio because it demonstrates my ability to apply core C++ programming concepts to solve a real-world problem. It reflects my growth in handling data, designing user-interactive programs, and developing readable and scalable code. It‚Äôs a project I can confidently show to future employers as evidence of my technical capabilities and attention to detail.

üîó Next Steps
I plan to continue building on this by creating more robust data tracking programs using modern C++ features and even explore adapting this idea into a GUI-based application or integrating it with a database.
